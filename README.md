# ðŸ’¤ My custom LazyVim config

This config uses the [starter template](https://github.com/LazyVim/starter) for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

## Requirements

- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation) (required for some grep functions within `telescope.nvim`)
- [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) (optional, the config only has some keymaps to open it that won't work if not installed)
- `gcc` or `clang` and `make` (dependencies of [`telescope-fzf-native.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim)) (all come pre-installed on macOS, not sure about other operating systems)
- [prettierd](https://github.com/fsouza/prettierd) (Prettier but faster)
- [eslint_d](https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js/) (ESLint but faster)
